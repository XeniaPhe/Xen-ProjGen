Welcome to the documentation of ***Xen ProjGen***! Xen Projgen is a simple python script that generates simple and highly customizable CMake C/C++ projects with single targets. It is aimed to eliminate the setup step for small and simple projects but it can also be used as a stepping stone for larger projects with more complex needs such as multiple targets, toolchain and preset files, cross-compiling, multi-step building etc. This guide should help you understand how to effectively work with this generated project structure.
