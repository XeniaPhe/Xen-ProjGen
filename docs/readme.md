Welcome to the documentation of ***`Xen ProjGen`***! Xen ProjGen is a python script that generates cross-platform, easy-to-use C/C++ projects with pre-configured CMake setups for single targets. It is aimed to eliminate the setup step for small and simple projects but it can also be used as a stepping stone for larger projects with more complex needs such as multiple targets, toolchain and preset files, cross-compiling, multi-step building etc. This guide should help you understand how to effectively work with this generated project structure.
